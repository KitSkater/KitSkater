Welcome to my GitHub!
Hello! I'm a passionate cybersecurity enthusiast actively preparing to deepen my skills in blue team operations and network defense. I'm currently in the pre-competition phase for CyberPatriot with my local Civil Air Patrol (CAP) unit, engaging in a mix of in-person and online training to build my expertise.

What I Do
Hands-on homelab projects — primarily using Raspberry Pi and Linux systems to experiment with network security and firewalls.
Exploring defensive cybersecurity techniques, focusing on blue team tools and strategies.
Gaining foundational experience with red team concepts like penetration testing and vulnerability assessment to better understand attacker methods.
Learning through CyberPatriot-related training provided by CAP and other online resources.
Practicing practical IT skills including networking basics and endpoint security.

Certifications
I’ve completed several certifications that underpin my foundational cybersecurity knowledge:

TryHackMe:
Pre-Security
Cybersecurity 101
Junior Pen Tester
Cisco Networking Academy:
Introduction to Cybersecurity
Cyber Threat Management
Network Defense
